# Thryft

CS-UY 4513 Software Engineering Project

The system, named Thryft, will be a centralized platform for buying and selling goods through a swipe-based interface inspired by Tinder. It is intended to be used by students, local sellers, and administrators who want a streamlined, engaging way to exchange goods. It features user authentication, listings, messaging, moderation, and more.

## Core Domain Concepts

### User

- Has authentication fields (email, password)
- Role fields: `is_moderator`, `is_admin` (supports user, moderator, admin roles)
- Owns listings, purchases, reports, interests
- Can be a buyer or seller in conversations/messages
- Helper methods for role checks and permissions

### Listing

- Belongs to a user (the seller)
- Has many reports, interests, and an attached image
- Can be filtered by category, price, search, and ownership
- Cannot be purchased more than once (enforced by scopes)

### Conversation

- Represents a chat between a buyer and seller about a listing
- Belongs to a buyer, seller, and listing
- Has many messages
- Ensures buyer and seller are different users

### Message

- Belongs to a user and a conversation
- Contains message content and read/unread state
- Tracks unread messages for users

### Purchase

- Belongs to a buyer (user) and a listing
- Represents a completed transaction

### Interest

- Belongs to a buyer (user) and a listing
- Tracks whether a user has liked or passed on a listing (swipe state)
- Enforces uniqueness per buyer-listing pair

### Report

## Navigation Overview

The main navigation (in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`) includes:

- **Home** – Dashboard / welcome page
- **Listings** – Browse, filter, and search all items for sale
- **My Listings** – Manage your own listings (edit, delete, view)
- **My Feed** – Personalized activity feed (swipe to like/pass, see new items)
- **Messages** – Direct messages inbox (conversations about listings)
- **Notifications** – Alerts for purchases, messages, and moderation
- **Moderation** – Admin/moderator tools (remove users/listings, view reports)
- **Settings** – Account settings (profile, password)
- **Log out** – End session

---

## My Feed

The My Feed feature is implemented in:

- `app/controllers/feed_controller.rb`
- `app/views/feed/index.html.erb`

**Controller responsibilities:**

- Shows listings not owned or already purchased by the user
- Applies filters: category, price range, search query
- Excludes listings the user has already swiped (liked/passed)
- Presents the next available listing to swipe

**View responsibilities:**

- Displays listing details and swipe actions (like/pass)
- Shows empty state if no more listings are available

---

## Following, Swiping, and Interests

- Users can swipe (like/pass) on listings in the feed
- Swipes are tracked as `Interest` records (liked or passed)
- Liked listings can be revisited; passed listings are hidden from the feed
- Moderators can view reported listings and users

---

## Architecture Notes

**Controllers:**

- `ApplicationController` – authentication helpers, current user, login required
- `UsersController` – user registration and profile
- `ListingsController` – CRUD for listings, filtering, sorting
- `FeedController` – personalized feed and swipe logic
- `MessagesController` – direct messages within conversations
- `ConversationsController` – manages buyer/seller chat about listings
- `PurchasesController` – handles purchases and purchase history
- `ReportsController` – reporting listings for moderation
- `ModerationsController` – admin/moderator actions (remove users/listings)
- `SwipesController` – handles swipe actions (like/pass)

**Models:**

- `User`, `Listing`, `Conversation`, `Message`, `Purchase`, `Interest`, `Report`

**Other notes:**

- Uses Rails scopes for filtering and searching listings
- Moderation actions are protected by role-based before_actions
- All user actions require authentication (except registration/login)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Ruby 3.4.7
- Rails 8.1.0
- Postgres

### Setup

After cloning the repo and having the necessary Ruby and Rails versions, run:

```sh
bundle install
```

#### Installing Postgres and Setting Up Local Database

**Linux (Ubuntu):**

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $(whoami)
```

**MacOS:**

```sh
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
createuser --superuser $(whoami)
```

**Windows:**
Just use WSL and follow the Linux instructions. Makes life easier. Trust me.

#### Database Initialization

Run this when setting up the project for the first time:

```sh
rails db:setup
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

#### Required Gem Setup

```sh
rails dartsass:install
rails generate rails_icons:install --libraries=heroicons
```

---

## Running the App 🏃‍♂️

Run the script:

```sh
bin/dev
```

### If CSS changes are not showing up

Sometimes, after adding or editing stylesheets, you may need to recompile Rails assets to see the changes:

```sh
bundle exec rails assets:clobber && bundle exec rails assets:precompile
```

Then restart your Rails server and refresh your browser (clear cache if needed).

---

## Testing

**Rspec:**

```sh
bundle exec rspec
```

**Cucumber:**

```sh
bundle exec cucumber
```
